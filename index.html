      My name is David and I've been delivering with Postmates for a while now. I created this page to make Postmates referral easy and straight forward.
      There is no secret, referral benefits both parties. If you are potentially interested in delivering for Postmates
      and getting benefits of a referred person, please click or tap the button below, it will open the Postmates Fleet
      sign up page in a new tab, my referral code will be atomatically applied and Postmates Fleet website will take it from there. Simple, no ads, your bonus
      will depend on the area you are planning to work in. With that said, Good Luck!
